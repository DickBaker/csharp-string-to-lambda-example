The "Easy way to create a C# lambda expression from a string (with Roslyn)" article on Filip's website

is backed by the related [filipw/csharp-string-to-lambda-example](https://github.com/filipw/csharp-string-to-lambda-example) repository
also originally released in 2018, with subsequent updates, although main Program.cs code has been unchanged.

FYI there is an excellent "[Expression Trees in C#](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/c-sharp-10-expression-trees/)" course on Pluralsight [original Nov 2022, updated Mar 2024] by [Chris B Behrens](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/chris-behrens) who has authored 69 courses [including 11 now retired] at time of writing this (June 2024).
Current PS subscribers can obtain the [Exercise files](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/c-sharp-10-expression-trees/exercise-files) download that includes both code and .PDF files only
- understanding-where-expressions-come-from-slides.pdf
- understanding-expression-trees-in-c-slides.pdf
- making-expression-trees-work-for-you-slides.pdf
- Course Links.rtf

where that .rtf file contains several short-links including [one](https://bit.ly/37STNmk) to Filip's article
(no, I couldn't relate that M4 Slide 29 to any slide in the .PDF decks or transcript either!)

Chris' public repository with code for this course is at https://github.com/FeynmanFan/csharp-expression-trees

Exploring Filip's website I discovered he has also written a book, released 2022-05-07
[Introduction to Quantum Computing with Q# and QDK](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-99379-5)
so worthwhile to explore both website and book for more great insights !
